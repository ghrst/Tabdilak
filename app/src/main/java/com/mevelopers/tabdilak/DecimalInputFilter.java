	 * Return the CharSequence that you would like to have placed there instead, including an empty string if appropriate, or null to accept the original
	 * replacement. Be careful to not to reject 0-length replacements, as this is what happens when you delete text. Also beware that you should not attempt
	 * to make any changes to dest from this method; you may only examine it for context. Note: If source is an instance of Spanned or Spannable, the span
	 * objects in the source should be copied into the filtered result (i.e. the non-null return value). copySpansFrom(Spanned, int, int, Class, Spannable, int)
	 * can be used for convenience.
